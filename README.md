- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sean Eva
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many things like Mathematics, Coding, and Gaming! I am always learning more about my interests and I am always looking to improve.
- I'm a student at Georgia Tech majoring in both mathematics and computer science (yes it is a little crazy).
- I'm fairly new to GitHub to please be patient with me! I plan to work on many projects over the next couple of years.
